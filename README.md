## How to compile

In the Java folder, run the command: mvn test.
It will build and run the test. I did not find how to run a main from the test package.

I simply used intellij to open the pom.xml and it allows to run the multiple tests and the main of the TexttestFicture.
If more information is needed to compile, please contact me.
